      <br><small>Talk given at Open Source Bridge, June 21, 2016</small></h3>
      <p>Technology is a language all its own, and open source is no exception. But as more people
        jump into the world of programming, they can be quickly overwhelmed by the volume of jargon. How,
        then, do we explain powerful technologies without misleading people?</p></li>

      <br><small>Talk given at RefreshPDX, Feb. 17, 2016</small></h3>
      <p>For many technically-minded people, "branding" and other business terms
        are a sort of taboo subject. Something looked at with disdain, or at minimum, skepticism.</p>
  <p>However, a strong personal brand can make a developer's career smoother.
    So, I've tried to explain the concepts in a way that skeptical techies - like myself - can understand.</p></li>
    <li class="document"><hr><h3><a href="/talks/wwc">On Selecting JavaScript Frameworks</a>
      <br><small>Talk given at Women Who Code Portland, Oct. 7 2015</small></h3>
      <p>For front-end developers, there's a never-ending stream of new things to learn.
        New frameworks, with new philosophies, seem to be released on a daily basis. How,
        then, do you pick which one to use? The answer, as it happens, has nothing to do at all with JavaScript.</p></li>
    <li class="document"><hr><h3><a href="/talks/fail">Fairwood Studios &amp; the Single Point of Failure</a>
      <br><small>Talk given at FailPDX, Feb. 15 2015</small></h3>
    <p>In 2009, I started a company making tracks for the Rock Band games.
      I worked with some impressive contacts and learned a ton of skills. It
      was a lovely experience and it was doomed from the start.</p></li>
