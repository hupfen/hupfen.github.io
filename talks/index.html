      <br><small>Talk given at ACT-W, April 23, 2016</small></h3>
      <p>A revision of my RefreshPDX talk. Here, marketing and branding get equal billing,
      using an understanding of personal brand to make marketing efforts more targeted
      and effective.</p></li>
    <li class="document"><hr><h3><a href="/talks/rfrsh">A Skeptic's Guide to Branding</a>
      <br><small>Talk given at RefreshPDX, Feb. 17, 2016</small></h3>
      <p>For many technically-minded people, "branding" and other business terms
        are a sort of taboo subject. Something looked at with disdain, or at minimum, skepticism.</p>
  <p>However, a strong personal brand can make a developer's career smoother.
    So, I've tried to explain the concepts in a way that skeptical techies - like myself - can understand.</p></li>
    <li class="document"><hr><h3><a href="/talks/wwc">On Selecting JavaScript Frameworks</a>
      <br><small>Talk given at Women Who Code Portland, Oct. 7 2015</small></h3>
      <p>For front-end developers, there's a never-ending stream of new things to learn.
        New frameworks, with new philosophies, seem to be released on a daily basis. How,
        then, do you pick which one to use? The answer, as it happens, has nothing to do at all with JavaScript.</p></li>
    <li class="document"><hr><h3><a href="/talks/fail">Fairwood Studios &amp; the Single Point of Failure</a>
      <br><small>Talk given at FailPDX, Feb. 15 2015</small></h3>
    <p>In 2009, I started a company making tracks for the Rock Band games.
      I worked with some impressive contacts and learned a ton of skills. It
      was a lovely experience and it was doomed from the start.</p></li>
