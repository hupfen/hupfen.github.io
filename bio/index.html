    A coworker once described me as "not odd, just Portland odd." I think that sums it up pretty well.

  <h2>
    Professional
  </h2>
  <p>
    I've been doing web development, in one form or another, since 2008. My first visible project was
    a redesign and re-engineering of the site for Signatures, my college's arts and literature magazine.
    Since then, I've moved from the world of PHP and jQuery to the world of C# and AngularJS &mdash;
    professionally, at least. My own work is more of a MEAN stack.
  </p>
  <p>
    The bulk of my work has fallen somewhere in the enterprise and SaaS domains. Earlier
    projects were more on the intranet side, and I have helped build a few e-commerce sites,
    but the predominant work lately has been targeted at subscribed end users. It's rare
    I do a marketing-style site for anyone other than myself.
  </p>
  <p>
    My college degree is in Software Engineering (with a minor in Creative Writing, because why not).
    I've always applied it to front-end work, but as of late that's been my principle focus. Any
    back-end work is now relegated to my personal projects &mdash; efforts I run both as
    experiments and as ways of learning more about business and general professional skills.

  <h2>Personal</h2>
  <p>
    Like many programmers, I was a bit of a geek growing up &mdash; a bit of video games, a bit
    of sci-fi. As I've grown up, I've veered more towards music as a point of interest, picking
    up drums and now playing as part of a <a href="http://mightymissoula.com" target="_blank">post-rock band.</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a frequent quizzer and general fan of trivia. I've always found that it provides a broader
    context on the world and helps fuel creativity. A good knowledge in trivia means a good body
    of things to pull from. (Plus it's fun to realize you know things.)
  </p>
  <p>
    For over a decade, off and on, I've been part of the furry community. It's an oft-maligned
    and usually secretive hobby, but the community has helped me in my most dire times and
    given me a worldview that seems to continuously pay dividends. I'm not afraid to be a bit of a rabbit,
    and, at least in Portland, people seem okay with playing along.
