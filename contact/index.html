    <p>
      For most communication, the best way to contact me is actually via <a href="https://twitter.com/hupfen">Twitter</a>.
      I tend to check it frequently, and the character limit keeps people from rambling. It also
      means I can answer quesitons publicly, which is sometimes desirable (especially on technical
      subjects, or really anything not super-personal).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're interested in working with me, or having me work on your project, go ahead and
      <a href="mailto:zoe@hupfen.com">email me</a>. I'm not always available for projects, but
      it can't hurt to reach out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other social mediums might work, but are unlikely. I tend to check them rarely.
