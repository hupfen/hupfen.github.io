    <p>
      The best way to contact me is actually via <a href="https://twitter.com/hupfen">Twitter</a>.
      I tend to check it frequently, and the character limit keeps people from rambling. It also
      means I can answer quesitons publicly, which is sometimes desirable (especially on technical
      subjects, or really anything not super-personal).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do wish to <a href="mailto:zoe@hupfen.com">email me</a> for any reason, feel free. Just
      note that I don't tend to check it as often, and nobody likes a super-long email.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other social mediums might work, but are unlikely. Those definitely require putting some care
      into the message.
    </p>
    <p>Don't bother calling me, if you happen to find my number. I never pick up.</p>
