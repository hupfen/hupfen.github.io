*This story was written for the January 1st NeoGAF Writing Challenge. The theme was "makes sense".*

"I don't get this at all," Alison said, looking up from the stack of stapled pages.

She flipped them back in order and dropped the pile on the diner table in front of her. The salt and pepper shakers rattled slightly, more from force than from weight. She sipped her coffee and looked Ellen in the eye, silently demanding an explanation.

Ellen crossed her arms over her stomach, looking out across the noisy restaurant. "It's a very simple plot," she said. She was always defensive of her plots. "What don't you get?"

"It's not really the plot. I don't get why you wrote it in the first place, much less why you gave it to me." She had a stern, motherly tone, mixed with frustration.

The mood needed softening, so Ellen went for flattery. "Well, you're my agent. You're good at getting deals. Of course I would come to you first."

Alison sighed, leaning back, sipping at her coffee. "I just expected something smarter from you. This is pretty banal."

Ellen started making her case. "Okay, fine, it's a bit mass-market, it's a bit silly-"

"It's called *Shocktopus*," Alison said with an annoyed deadpan.

Ellen waved the fact away. "We can work on the title. The point is, this is something exciting! Something we can actually sell!"

Alison shook her head as she sipped her coffee. "No, we can't. I wouldn't want to anyway."

"Why?"

"I have a reputation to uphold. You have a reputation to uphold. Do you really want Ellen Koppel to be known for some B-movie schlock?"

She rolled her eyes, unpersuaded by the arguments. "One, pen name. Two, this is about Jacques, isn't it?"

Alison grimaced. Ellen smiled, knowing she hit a nerve. "Don't start."

Ellen sat back and sipped her coffee. She was rarely prepared for the combat, but when she was, she relished it. "Already started. You had a lucky hit with him - and you said it was lucky, so don't even - and now you just want us all to reproduce it."

The waitress arrived with their brunch, interrupting the conversation. Alison gave her a cheerful smile and nod in thanks. Ellen was more focused on reading Alison's reactions, looking for a spot to probe, a seam to dig into further. She didn't have any reason to be curious about the meal.

Alison delayed eating. She glanced out the window, collecting her thoughts. "Look. I know you can write serious, literary stuff. You know you can write it. And we both know I can sell it."

"Worked great for *The Established*," Ellen said. She glared across the table as she took a bite.

"I can't help it if the publisher botches the marketing. And they admitted it too, you know I'm not making excuses here."

"Fair." She poked at her omelette. "But I need to do something more mass-market. I can't be taking another risk like that."

"It's not a risk. Not any more than anything else."

"Maybe not for you."

Alison groaned. She could understand why Ellen was so agitated, but it didn't make the attacks any easier to take.

"Seriously. You've got Jacques. You can afford to be careful with things. I can't."

"The hell do you mean?"

Ellen put her fork down. "You're covering brunch, right?"

"Of course. Always do."

"Because you know I couldn't. I'm splitting this little apartment in Kensington, but that only does so much. And right now, I've got a couple stories in anthologies and one novel that bombed. I'm not a success."

"Yet," Alison insisted.

"Which is why I wrote this," she said, grabbing the manuscript. "This is such an easy sell. I don't care if it's any good, I don't care if it's even under my name. Like, whatever, I just need a sell."

Alison sighed. "I won't be able to sell it."

"Bullshit."

"No, I mean it. Every publisher, I know somebody. You pass me a thriller, I'll give it to the guy who reads thrillers. Contemporary fic, same thing. That's how I get deals." She pointed at the manuscript. "I don't know anyone who reads that. It'd be the same as if you went in blind."

Ellen paused, staring forward. "Well. Fuck."

"Exactly." Alison didn't look up from her plate. "This is what I was saying, I can't sell something like this."

"You could find the people, though, right?" She made no effort to hide her desperation. "They must exist. There are shelves full of this stuff, people at the publishers have to be reading it."

"I'm sure someone is. Don't know who. I can find out, get the relationships going, but that would take a while. Months, maybe a year. It doesn't sound like you have that kind of time."

Ellen closed her eyes and sighed. "Alright. Fine. You win."

"Don't say it like that, Ellen. I'll still try to get you the deal, it just won't be as easy."

"Doesn't do anything for the short term. That's the only reason I wrote that thing."

"I know." Allison paused in thought. "How about this. How quick do you think you can get something like *The Established* put together? Just a draft."

Ellen shrugged. "Two months? Could be just one, if I'm not doing anything else. And if I really push."

"Then push. Once you have that, I'll try to get a provisional deal. Won't be much, but it'll buy you some time."

"You seriously think anyone's gonna care that much about my work?"

Alison smirked. "They'll care about Jacques. I do have a reputation now. Might as well use it."

"Jeez, no pressure."

"Well, if you had just written some sensible drama like you're supposed to, you wouldn't be in this mess."

Ellen wasn't sure if she was joking or not. "Serves me right for trying to be mass-market."

"To be fair, this is better than some of the mass-market stuff you were going for."

"It's still stupid," she said, conceding.

Alison laughed. "Oh, it's incredibly stupid. But at least, it's not bad."
