    <p>RCRDList highlights a different interesting and obscure album every day.
    I do the curation, along with a handful of other music fans and experts, and
  I'm responsible for all of the project's web presence and marketing. It was
started as a marketing tool for RCRDBox, but it took on a life of its own. It's
now got almost 1,500 subscribers.</p><hr></li>
    <li class="document"><h4><a href="https://rcrdbox.com/">RCRDBox</a></h4>
    <p>RCRDBox sells vinyl records and mystery. Each box contains a grouping
    of random albums, loosely related and fairly obscure. RCRDBox was initially
  a subscription service, with a handful of local subscribers, but I'm gradually
moving it towards a general ecommerce concept.</p><hr></li>

    <li class="document"><h4>Fairwood Studios</h4>
    <p>Fairwood Studios was my Rock Band Network authoring company. It was a solo
    effort, and one I took on even though I never did audio engineering before.
  The end result was the largest output by a solo author- over 90 songs in 4 years,
relationships with a bunch of bands and labels, and even a chance to interview
Sir Christopher Lee.</p><hr></li>
      <li class="document"><h4>Indie Allstars</h4>
      <p>In May 2011, I put together a pay-what-you-want music bundle with some
      of my contacts through Fairwood Studios. It only ran two weeks, but it
    still sold over 650 copies. I wrote all of the site's code from scratch;
  it was a bit rough around the edges, technically and design-wise, but it did
what it needed to do.</p><hr></li>
