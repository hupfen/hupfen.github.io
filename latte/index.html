  <p>Thank you for being curious enough to check this out! Yes, I threw an ad in your Easter egg.
  For a book about talking animals.</p>
  <p><em>The Latte Segment</em> is my first published novel. I wanted to capture the strange
  and at times contradictory mood of growing up with a growing city. The result has a bit of
  fantasy to it (as much fantasy as talking animals can provide) and, I hope, an interesting character as well.</p>
  <p>If you've been a fan of <i>Bojack Horseman</i>, <i>Zootopia</i>, or Vice's <i>Habits</i> comic series,
  I hope you give my book a try. And if you do, I hope you enjoy it! I'm open to any sorts of comments or questions
  you have &mdash; whether they're about my book or my slightly strange advertising campaign. (But hey, you did
  get candy out of it!) Feel free to <a href="mailto:zoe@leporidaemedia.com">email them to me.</a> I'd appreciate it!</p>
  <p><em>&mdash; Zoe Landon</em></p>

    <h2 class="text-center">About <em>The Latte Segment</em></h2>
    <p>Sarah Madsen is a modern young rabbit with a cozy urban life. A yuppie, perhaps, though sheâ€™d disagree with the
      label. After all, yuppies donâ€™t hang with eccentric artists in beat-down studios, much less date them. And they
      donâ€™t get pushed out of their apartment by profit-hunting developers, forced to pick between an impossible
      market and an unsustainable rent.</p>
    <p>As she hunts for a new place to live, she learns how her comfortable lifestyle is seen by those around her.
      Some are sympathetic and kind, some cold and indifferent, some jealous and hostile. None can relieve her
      frustration from knowing that her easy life is slowly slipping out of her control. Sheâ€™ll take control
      anywhere she can find it, but not everyone appreciates her attempts to help. Not even herself.</p>
    <p>A story of class and success in the millennial age, <em>The Latte Segment</em> explores how well we can
      trust others, and ourselves, to do the right things in our lives - or, to do anything about them at all.</p>
